# Hone Embed

Simple interactions with embedded Hone Questions and Quizzes.


## Installation

If you copied the embeded code from the gohone.com interface you can just add a `data-hone` attribute to the iframe to enable the code to run against that embed.

```html
<iframe src="..." data-hone data-resize="true"></iframe>
```

optionally you can try out a beta feature that allows the iframe to resize its height dynamically to the content inside of the iframe by adding a `data-resize` attribute to the iframe.

Include the script into your page ( script located in `build` directory ).

```html
<script src="/path-to/embed.js"></script>
```

## Usage

After you load the script we export out a `hone` variable into the `window`, or global scope. First you need to initialize the script and then you can attach event bindings to that variable.

```javascript
hone.init();

hone.on( 'voted', function( e ) {
    // when the users votes, you could, for example:
    //   - refresh ads on the page
    //   - look at the selected item in the event and update ads
    //   - track a metric of your own
} );
```

## Available Events

## Examples 

Checkout the `examples` directory


## Creating a build

Also if you want a minified version, you can build one. You will need [nodejs]( http://nodejs.org ) and [grunt]( http://gruntjs.com/ ).

    # to install global grunt run
    $ npm install -g grunt-cli 

Once you have those installed you can then run in your teminal.

    $ npm install

This will install all the development dependecies and then run

    $ grunt dist

This will create a `dist` directory and compile a script with the name `hone-embed-0.1.0.js` that file will be compressed and read to use in the scrip tag.

## Contributing

You will need `grunt` cli.

    $ npm install -g grunt-cli

Then install dev dependecies

    $ npm install

To build embed script and run server for examples

    $ grunt

Once you have a working piece of code open a pull request. :+1:
